# MusicClassification
ML model to use music data i get from spotify and turn it into a ML model to classify songs by genre. I will also try to use Django later down the liine to create a web app that anyone can use to upload a spectrogram and classify a song of their choosing.

Currently planning to pull data from top spotify playlists find it on youtube, convert it to a spectrogram, and then use that and the features from the spotify data to get the predictions
